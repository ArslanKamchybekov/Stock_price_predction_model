# Stock_price_predction_model
For this project, I used the data from different stocks using Yahoo Finance API. Using that data, I trained the machine learning model to predict the price of any stock according to its past performance.

I used Python and Jypiter Notebook to build the model. I imported the dataset and CSV file from YFinance, and built the LSTM Model using RNN layers.

The dataset was imported from this link: [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)
